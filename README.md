# gen-js4-async-fetch

## Create a fetch() request to display the users GitHub Repositories

1. Every member of the group will follow the following instructions with the help of the group:
    * FORK this repository onto your github
    * Copy the https URL from your FORKED repo
    * Navigate to Git Bash on your local machine and `cd` to a place you wish to clone this activity to work on it
    * Once where you need to be in bash, run `git clone ` followed by the URL you copied from your forked copy of this github repository
    * Open VSCode, select `File` in the top right, and select `Open Folder` 
    * Find the folder you cloned named `gen-async-fetch-lesson` and open it, then begin working in the `script.js` file while using the instructions below.

2. Select one group member to share their screen and work together to solve each step of this activity. **Every individiual should be also coding in VSCode.** If you get stuck, don't forget to use your Google-Fu and problem solving skills. TA's will be hopping into each room to check in, message one of us on Slack for specific help.

3. It is completed when I click the "Fetch User Repos" button, and a list of my GitHub repositories displays on the page.

4. When your team is finished with the activity, submit a pull request from your fork!


## ðŸ’¡ Hints

* How can we use the [GitHub API documentation on repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) to support this implementation?

* Where in the URL string is the repository endpoint added?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research any additional questions.
